# Hyperloop âˆž

Hyperloop is a next-generation compiler that converts JavaScript source code into native code for targeting different native OS platforms.

> **THIS IS UNSTABLE, UNRELEASED CODE. DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION YET.**

## Requirements

Hyperloop requires at least [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) 0.10.5 and iOS SDK 7.0.  _Currently, hyperloop is only being developed and tested on OSX, however, Windows and Linux will eventually be supported officially._

## Install

To install hyperloop, using node npm:

```bash
[sudo] npm install hyperloop -g
```

## Quick Start

You can see examples under the `examples` directory.

To compile, package and launch for iOS, use an example of the following command-line:

```bash
hyperloop package --platform=ios --src=examples/simple/ --dest=build --name=foo --appid=com.foo --launch
```

The initial compile will take a minute or so to generate the AST for the system frameworks. However, subsequent compiles will be almost instantaneous as it will be cached.  In the future, we plan on speeding this up greatly.

If all goes well, this should compile the application source code and the native application and launch it in the iOS Simulator.

*Note:* Add the `--clean` command to clean the `build` dir before building a different example.

## Platforms Supported

The following Platforms are being targeted for supported.

### Current (already working)

- _iOS_ - iOS 7.0

### Planned (in development)

- _Android_ - Android
- _Windows 8_ - Win8 desktop
- _Windows Phone 8_ - Windows Phone / Tablet
- _OSX_ - OSX desktop

### Experimental Ideas

- _Tizen_ - Tizen OS
- _Leapmotion_ - Leapmotion SDK
- _Firefox OS_ - Firefox OS
- _Blackberry_ - BB 10

## Examples

We have built a few examples to show off our work.  Please look in the [Examples](https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop/tree/master/examples) folder for them.  Please help by contribributing new examples that show off the power of Hyperloop.

## Design

Hyperloop works by using a high-level [DSL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) written in JavaScript and compiling that into native code using an [AOT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOT_compiler) compiler.

The compiler is broken into two subsystems: _backend_ and _frontend_.  The _frontend_ will parse the input JavaScript source code and transform it into an [AST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) and will resolve special reserved JavaScript keywords which instruct the compiler to perform specific code transformations (we call this CNI, short for Common Native Interface).  Once CNI instructions are encountered, the _backend_ compiler will emit the appropriate language and OS specific code for the target platform.  The _backend_ compiler is specific to each OS while the _frontend_ compiler is generic for all platforms.

#### Generating Code

The backend compiler will turn the appropriate CNI into the target language of that platform. For example, for iOS, the backend will generate Objective-C source code.  For Android, the backend will generate Java, and so forth.

The backend code will generate JS VM specific code, depending on the engine specified.  By default, the backend will generate code for the [JavaScriptCore](http://trac.webkit.org/wiki/JavaScriptCore) engine (or "JSCore") which is part of the [WebKit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebKit) opensource project.  Currently, Hyperloop only supports JSCore. However, we intend to support [V8](https://code.google.com/p/v8/) eventually as well.

#### JavaScriptCore

For JSCore, we have extended it to support additional platforms beyond iOS, such as Android and Windows 8.  In addition, we have extended JSCore to include additional capabilities which work with our compiler instructions.  All of our extensions are available in our public fork of [WebKit](https://github.com/appcelerator/webkit), currently on the branch named `javascriptcore_jsexport_api`.


## Current Limitations

### iOS / OSX


#### Instances with other than init constructors

To create a new instance, typically `[[obj alloc] init]`, you should use `new Object` in CNI. However, often, you want to call a specific init method.  For example:

~~~objective-c
var window = [[NSWindow alloc] initWithContentRect:NSRectMake(0,0,100,200) styleMask:NSTitledWindowMask backing:NSBackingStoreBuffered defer:NO];
~~~

For CNI, you would use the following method.

~~~javascript
var window = NSWindow.alloc().initWithContentRect(NSRectMake(0,0,100,200),NSTitledWindowMask,NSBackingStoreBuffered,false);
~~~

#### Named method arguments with different names but same number of parameters

Currently, if you have multiple methods with the same first argument name and different additional arguments as part of the selector and the number of arguments are the same, only the first method will be generated.  We will address this limitation before release.


## Tooling Plugins

## FAQ

#### [iOS] Will this work with iOS 5 or iOS 6?

Nope. iOS 7 is the current minimum for this architecture.

#### [iOS] What happens when I add my own methods to UIView (for example)?  i.e. subclass it?  Does it get compiled in to the native class?  Or is it JS only?  Or maybe there's a specific syntax used to make it a native method vs. JS-only method?

Any JS Object (i.e. Class) imported in principle is a first-class JS object where the native methods and properties are prototypes on the returned JS Object.  This will allow you to also add your own functions and properties to the returned Object as either direct properties of the object or on the prototype of the JS class.

#### Why the non-standard JS symbols like @?

We wanted to specifically distinguish specific keywords that we're using as _special_ CNI keywords distinctly.  We want developers to understand that these keywords are specific to CNI compile-time syntax, thus the special `@` symbol prefix.  This is very similar to what other compilers do such as clang using `@import` to import modules or C pre-processor using `#ifdef` to tell the compiler that it wants to do something special before compiling the language.
#### Can I write modules?

For Titanium (and Hyperloop), modules just become Hyperloop CNI code packaged as [Common JS](http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS) and loaded via `require`. In essence, modules as you think of them in traditional Titanium code are now written inline using the target platform's own APIs, directly in Javascript. We will make a new packaging mechanism to make it easier to distribute them such as Node does with NPM modules.

## Hyperloop and Titanium

The next generation Titanium SDK, called [Ti.Next](http://ceogeek.tumblr.com/post/54456815189/thoughts-on-ti-next), is being rebuilt around Hyperloop.  However, we are separating the new compiler (hyperloop) in a standalone project so that developers can use hyperloop without Titanium.  Ti.Next uses the hyperloop compiler to build the new Titanium SDK.

The target for "hyperloop standalone" is developers who would like to write native applications using JavaScript (as a language) but prefer to use the target platforms API directly, instead of using the cross-platform Titanium API.

## Reporting Bugs or submitting fixes

If you run into problems, and trust us, there are likely plenty of them at this point -- please create an [Issue](https://github.com/appcelerator/hyperloop/issues) or, even better, send us a pull request. You should also check out the [Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tinext).

## Contributing

Hyperloop is an open source project.  Hyperloop wouldn't be where it is now without contributions by the community. Please consider forking Hyperloop to improve, enhance or fix issues. If you feel like the community will benefit from your fork, please open a pull request.

To protect the interests of the Hyperloop contributors, Appcelerator, customers and end users we require contributors to sign a Contributors License Agreement (CLA) before we pull the changes into the main repository. Our CLA is simple and straightforward - it requires that the contributions you make to any Appcelerator open source project are properly licensed and that you have the legal authority to make those changes. This helps us significantly reduce future legal risk for everyone involved. It is easy, helps everyone, takes only a few minutes, and only needs to be completed once.

[You can digitally sign the CLA](http://bit.ly/app_cla) online. Please indicate your email address in your first pull request so that we can make sure that will locate your CLA.  Once you've submitted it, you no longer need to send one for subsequent submissions.
